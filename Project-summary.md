# EduVerify & Career Compass

## Core Concept:
**EduVerify & Career Compass** is a secure digital platform designed to simplify academic and career progression for students. It acts as a personal digital locker for verified academic and official documents, combined with an intelligent recommendation engine for jobs and scholarships.

## How It Works:

### 1. **Document Verification & Digital Locker:**
- Students upload their important documents (e.g., government IDs, academic certificates, mark sheets) as images or by providing an application number.
- The system (initially using dummy data, later connecting to legit sources) verifies these documents.
- Once verified, the documents are digitally signed and stored securely in the student's personal digital locker, similar to DigiLocker.
- Students can easily share these verified, tamper-proof documents with educational institutions during admissions or with potential employers.

### 2. **Intelligent Recommendation Engine:**
- Using the verified data from the student's profile (grades, degree, income category), the platform automatically scans and fetches relevant government jobs and scholarships from various online sources.
- **Personalized Matching**: It intelligently filters these opportunities, only showing the student listings for which they are genuinely eligible.

### 3. **Skill & Opportunity Analysis (LLM-Powered):**
- For each job recommendation, a Large Language Model (LLM) will analyze the job description to:
  - Identify and list the key required skills.
  - Compare these skills against the student's profile.
  - Provide a "match percentage" indicating the likelihood of the student securing the position, highlighting skill gaps and strengths.

## Key Goal:
To create a centralized, trustworthy ecosystem that streamlines the document verification process for students while providing them with highly personalized and actionable career and scholarship opportunities.
